# CigaretteAfterSex
CigaretteAfterSex is a popular American pop band formed by Greg Gonzalez.
The style of his music was emotional yet meaningful, it was said that Greg Gonzalez had the name idea after being with a woman who smoked after they were together. 
After the band was formed, their songs became popular on YouTube and were well-known by many people who felt relatable to the songs.
Therefore, the decision to design a website for CigaretteAfterSex came to my mind as it was simple yet relatable to many people.
